                <p>Revolutionizing Ocean Cleanup with Autonomous Technology</p>
                <p>
                    Ocean pollution, particularly plastic waste, is one of the most pressing environmental challenges
                    of our time. Our team’s project, NELBot, was designed to address this issue through innovation,
                    sustainability, and advanced engineering. NELBot is an autonomous submarine robot that
                    collects underwater debris, prioritizing efficiency and environmental conservation. By leveraging
                    artificial intelligence, sustainable materials, and precision mechanical systems, NELBot aims to
                    make a significant impact in the fight against marine pollution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the core of NELBot's capabilities is its advanced sensing and AI-driven perception system.
Using the YOLOv5s machine learning model, NELBot can accurately detect and differentiate
between ocean debris and marine life. This ensures that NELBot focuses its efforts on collecting
trash, minimizing harm to the delicate marine ecosystem. The robot uses a hybrid collection
technique, deploying robotic arms for debris adhered to the ocean floor while utilizing
interconnected baskets for floating debris clusters. This design not only reduces energy
consumption but also extends the robot’s operational duration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mechanically, NELBot is built to withstand the harsh underwater environment. Its main casing is
constructed from carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), which offers excellent strength and
corrosion resistance. Additionally, recycled steel and aluminum alloys are used for structural
components, aligning with our commitment to sustainable materials. Biocomposites and bio-
based polymers are used in non-structural parts, further reducing the vehicle’s environmental
impact.
NELBot’s propulsion and power systems are designed for efficiency and endurance. Powered by
solar panels and 24V batteries, NELBot operates autonomously for extended periods, ensuring
maximum impact with minimal energy use. This hybrid power approach makes NELBot a
sustainable solution to marine pollution.

                <h5>NEL Nights" Webinar Series - Unveiling the Future of Engineering with AI!</h5>
                <p>The "NEL Nights" webinar series is a powerful platform aimed at building the capacities of
                    young engineers by equipping them with essential knowledge of artificial intelligence (AI) and
                    its practical applications in their fields. By exploring AI's role in geographic systems, building
                    technologies, mechanical engineering, and robotics, this event helps future engineers understandhow to leverage AI to innovate within their work. More than just technical knowledge, the series
                    also contributes to global efforts toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
                    by promoting sustainable engineering solutions. By integrating AI, young engineers can drive
                    advancements that address challenges in infrastructure, industry, and environmental
                    sustainability.</p>
